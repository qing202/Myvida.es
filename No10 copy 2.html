            <a>La Chinata lifting effect face mask is elaborated through a formula based on salts and trace element-rich sludge that produce high hydration and softness of the skin. Besides, it contains tensing agents that act on wrinkles. 
              It also as Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), thermal waters concentrated and a complex made of extracts that add moisturising to the skin.
              On one side, EVOO acts as a natural hydrant that repairs the barrier function of the skin along with adding anti-aging and antioxidant effects. At the same time, properties from thermal waters add up with their calming and softening action, perfect for sensitive and reddened types of skin. The complex acts as firming element in areas such as the eye contour and helps blood circulation and the metabolism of our skin.
              Masks intensify a specific action and have an immediate effect. That is why, it is important to choose the most suitable one to each of our skin needs, as they adjust to specific demands. The type of masks we will need depends on climate, routine, sun exposure… Thus, we have a wide range of masks: purifying, revitalizing, nutritional and lifting effect.
              To display a proper application, a thin layer should be spread on the face and leave it there for 10 to 15 minutes. Next, rinse with warm water until removal of the product off of the face. It is recommended to be used once per week.
              For the full treatment, after mask, it is advised to apply Antiox Regenerating Facial Serum and afterwards, La Chinata Moisturizing Cream.</a>
