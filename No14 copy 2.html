            <a>The anti-spot illuminating ampoules are the solution to help prevent and minimize all types of spots, especially the hyperpigmented ones caused by age and excessive solar radiation.
              They are formulated with cress sprout and soy, as well as a combination of powerful depigmenting active ingredients that help prevent and minimize all types of spots, especially hyperpigmented spots caused by age and excessive solar radiation. It also contains stabilized vitamin C, which prevents the skin oxidation, brings luminosity and unifies the tone of the face; and the olive leaf extract is present as well, which acts as an antioxidant, anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory.</a>
