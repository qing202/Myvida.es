            <a>The Repairing Oil acts during the night, as the skin repairs itself during sleep and enters a phase of rest and cell regeneration. With this, it acts as an antioxidant, prevents the appearance of signs of aging and provides hydration to the skin.
              It is made with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, a great antioxidant and skin conditioner, and with evening primrose oil, rich in omega 6 fatty acids, which deeply nourish the skin, help regenerate tissues and reduce signs of fatigue and aging skin.
              It also has olive seed oil, with moisturizing and antioxidant qualities; with grapeseed oil, which repairs, hydrates and purifies, as well as with lavender oil, perfect for soothing sensitive or irritated skin.
              The result is a more nourished, hydrated, rested and luminous skin.</a>
