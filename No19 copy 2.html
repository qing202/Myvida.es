            <a>La Chinata Miracle Oil is a multifunction elixir with a large percentage of Extra Virgin Olive Oil that deeply hydrates and nourishes our skin as well as our face and hair.
              It is an “off-road” dry oil that has extraordinary moisturizing agents that soften and leave a radiant appearance, without leaving residues and fast absorption, which also offers firming and antioxidant properties thanks to its formula with tepescohuite and immortelle.
              It has multiple applications; On the one hand, it is recommended to add a few drops of oil in the bathroom, or with your facial cream both day or night, as well as after sun exposure. 
              You can also apply a drop mixed with makeup as it leaves a more natural effect.
              
              Also, for hair care, you can apply a few drops of oil on the ends with damp hair and do not rinse. In the same way, as a mask, more medium is applied to the ends, it is left to act for 10 minutes and the hair is washed afterwards.</a>
